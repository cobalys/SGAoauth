TODO
=====

 1. Clean tokens: Set automatic and manual mechanism.
 2. Request Token lifetime: Set value from settings (permanent or temporary).
 3. Secrecy of the Consumer Secret: In many applications, the Consumer 
 	application will be under the control of potentially untrusted parties. 
 	For example, if the Consumer is a freely available desktop application, 
 	an attacker may be able to download a copy for analysis. In such cases, 
 	attackers will be able to recover the Consumer Secret used to authenticate 
 	the Consumer to the Service Provider.
    Accordingly, Service Providers should not use the Consumer Secret alone to
    verify the identity of the Consumer. Where possible, other factors such as
    IP address should be used as well.
 4. Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
 5. Version 1.0: Add version parameter to all queries.
 6. Repeated tokens: Set mechanism to prevent collisions.
 7. Optimize CSS in Test templates
 8. Authorize Token request: Login is not enough, let the user implement his own
	mechanism.
